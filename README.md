# Basic Portfolio

## Overview

This project involves building a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS. Using some CSS concepts such as float, padding, margin, display, overflow, clear and text-align, the app an aesthetically pleasing layout is designed while creating different kinds of complex HTML elements.

## Front-end Web Design
This is the first opportunity as a front-end web designer in which a portfolio is made and a first step is taken toward building a web development brand.

## Procedure

* Create a new repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.

* Clone this repository to the local computer.

* Navigate to the Basic-Portfolio folder  and inside this folder, create the following:

  * 3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html
  * A folder called assets.
  * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: 
    * css and 
    * images.
      * In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
      * In the css folder, make a file called reset.css and include the code found from the Meyerweb reset located: [Meyer Website](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css)
      * In the images folder, save the images to be used in the app (such as the profile image, the placeholder images for the portfolio, and the social icon images).
  * Push the above changes to GitHub using the normal process:
    * git add . 
    * git commit -m "initial site files" and 
    * git push origin master.

## Important Information
In creating this website, the standard practice of coding the HTML files before writing any CSS -- and writing up one HTML file before moving onto the next are followed. 

HTML is written semantically, too:
  * If something is a heading, a heading tag is used.
  * If something is a list, an unordered or ordered list tag is used.

* The content for the index.html is my Bio - Angus Ogubuike.
* A paragraph is written about myself.
* The main logo has my name. 
* Code is added, committed, and pushed to GitHub often.
* After all of the html is written, the pages are styled using the style.css file created using the following specifications:

  * Colors: The Eye Dropper Chrome extension [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) is used to find the colors used on web pages.
    * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): #4aaaa5
    * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings) = #777777
    * Main header background color: #ffffff
    * Main header border color: #cccccc
    * Footer background color: #666666
    * Main content background color: #ffffff
    * Main content border color: #dddddd
  * Fonts
    * Heading fonts use font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;
    * All other fonts use 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;
  * Profile Image Found on index.html
     * Used a picture of myself.
     * Save the images to the images folder
  * Portfolio Images
    * Placeholder images found in [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/).
    * Save the images to your images folder
    * Social Link Images (Github, LinkedIn and StackOverflow) found on  [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) are saved in the images folder
  * Background Images
    The background pattern used is found on [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/). 
  * Dimensions
     * The entire content area is 960px wide.
     * The main section content is 650px wide.
     * The sidebar is 270px wide.
     * The chrome [Page Ruler] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en) extension is used to measure the size of elements

* Finally the pages are made more sophisticated by adding style to text links, image links and buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. 
* [Adobe Kuler] (https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) is used for finding colors that match the theme (In this case, the primary color is Teal #4aaaa5).

* The html is validated using [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

## Footer
A 'sticky footer' is made. The dark grey footer rests just below the content. The footer is coded in such a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. 

* The website is deployed to heroku
