		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>I am a full stack web developer working on my coding certificate at the Center for Professional Education, The University of Texas at Austin. My background in Statistics helps me to understand complex data and to solve complex problems. I attended a business school with Doctorate degree in business administration which helps me to understand complex leadership issues required to contribute effectively in a growth oriented organization.</p> 
		
		<p>Thanks for working in corporate environments and multinational oil companies as a petroleum (reservoir) engineer, I am able to work well on own initiative and can demonstrate high level of motivation required to meet the tightest of deadlines.</p>
